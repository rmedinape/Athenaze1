Here you'll find the answers to 

Balme and Lawall's Athenaze (2011), Italian Edition. (ISBN 978-88-95611-49-5) and Consoli's (2003) Μελετήματα (ISBN 978-88-95611-30-3).

Note: I do not include the answers for the Greek to Italian translations unless I find it necessary, most of the time only the Italian to Greek translations are provided.

In order to make the documents easier to read, each Chapter is divided into two sections, the first one includes the answers to the Athenaze exercises, the second includes the answers to Consoli's μελετήματα.

I numerate the exercises in Greek.

Exercices.
