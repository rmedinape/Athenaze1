Here you'll find the answers to 

Balme and Lawall's Athenaze (2011), Italian Edition. (ISBN 978-88-95611-49-5) and Consoli's (2003) Μελετήματα (ISBN 978-88-95611-30-3). 

You can buy the books here https://vivariumnovum.it/catalogo/greco/corso-base

Note: On I do not include the answer's for the Greek to Italian translations because I find it unnecessary, you'll find just the Italian to Greek translations.

In order to make it easier to read each Chapter is divided into two sections, the first one includes the answers to the Athenaze exercises, the second includes the answers to Consoli's μελετήματα.

I numerate the exercises in Greek.

Exercices.
